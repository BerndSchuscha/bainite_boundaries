# Hints
Most people do not like to write documentation or tests. 
But everybody tests his code to see if it works. 
Most of the time these Trials full of print statements get deleted after recieveing positive conformation.
Yet if you write these trials into sepperate files as Examples of how to use your Code, Even just for yourself to see if everything works correct,
Then you have a great starting point for writing Tests and Documentation.
ProTip: With sufficient Examples you can also delegate this task to Student-Workers, So they write documentation and tests
